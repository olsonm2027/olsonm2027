## Introduction

My name is Matthew Olson, I'm a Capricon, I enjoy sunsets, long walks on the beach and this is my repository for my C++ class at FTCC.
I'm talking courses for a certification in cyber security and I believe having knowledge on different languages will improve my performance in the workforce.
